    "section": "2- Hypothesis",
    "text": "2- Hypothesis\nMy main hypothesis is that we will observe a greater underperfomance of Brazil’s GDP per capita trend in comparison to the counterfactual (the synthetic control) than the 12% found in Carrasco, Mello, and Duarte (2014) This hypothesis is based on three main arguments.\nFirst, my analysis will be based on a dataset that has data for the recent Brazilian recession of 2014-2016, which is not present in the main results from Carrasco, since their dataset only goes up to 2012.\nSecond, I hypothesize that we collective work that has been done to methodically map the event that marked the dawn of a new era in economic policymaking in Brazil will pay off in terms of providing more robust and trustworthy results for the synthetic control.\nThird, building upon the previous two arguments, it has been shown that the NEM had negative effects in the Brazilian economy. Bráulio Borges (2017) uses three different methodological approaches to argue that – both domestic and external – factors exogenous to the Brazilian economy are responsible for approximately 50% of the economic downturn in the 2012 - 2016 period. While he demonstrates support for some policies packaged within the NEM and argues that the deceleration in potential growth can be tied to several factors that are exogenous to (independent of) economic policy, the author accepts that most of the remaining 50% are caused by domestic economic policy mistakes of the NEM (not all of the remaining 50%, since the author leaves room for measurement errors there)."

    "text": "3- Data, sample, and visualization\n\nData and Sample\nMy unit of analysis will be a country-year panel. I downloaded my dataset from the World Bank’s World Development Indicators (WDI). While the WB produces a lot of the data points in the WDI dataset, the OECD, IMF, UN, and ILO are responsible for some of the variables I downloaded. I also merged my original dataset with additional data points on government debt (from the IMF) and terms of trade (from the OECD). My raw dataset is composed of 35 countries and 72 variables over the 1970-2022 period. After extensive research and analysis, I have decided that my synthetic control model will be based on a sample of 20 countries and 8 variables over the 1990-2018 period. Details are provided below.\nCountry of interest: Brazil.\nCountry pool (that will be fed into the model to create the synthetic control): Bolivia, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Egypt, India, Iran, Mexico, Pakistan, Paraguay, Peru, Poland, South Africa, Türkiye, Ukraine, Uruguay.\nVariable of interest: GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2017 international $).\nCovariates: Agriculture, forestry, and fishing, value added (% of GDP); GDP per capita, PPP (constant 2017 international $); Gross capital formation (% of GDP); Industry (including construction), value added (% of GDP); Inflation, consumer prices (annual %); Net barter terms of trade index (2015 = 100); Trade Openness (% of GDP) (defined as Exports of goods and services (% of GDP) + Imports of goods and services (% of GDP), following Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2015) and the concept of additive indexes we learned in class); and Unemployment, total (% of total labor force) (national estimate).\nPre-intervention period: 1990 - 2005\nPost-intervention period: 2006 (intervention year) - 2018 (the last year before Jair Bolsonaro, the winner of the 2018 Presidential Elections, took over as President).\nIntervention of interest: The change in Finance Minister in early 2006. Antônio Palocci was replaced by Guido Mantega, setting off the policy changes that encompass what is defined as the New Economic Matrix.\n\n\nPreliminary Visualization\nI created two preliminary figures that trace Brazilian GDP per Capita in comparison with selected countries. The goal of this preliminary visualization exercise is twofold. One, to investigate whether Brazil actually took off in the early 2000s, as the 2009 cover for The Economist affirmed. Two, to make the case for why the synthetic control method is the best empirical tool available to help me shed light upon my research question.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 (Latin American average is defined as the average values for Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay)\n\n\n\n\nIn Figure 1, we see that Brazil starts the 2000s with GDP per capita levels significantly below that of Argentina, Chile, and Mexico. Brazil spends most of the following 16 years relatively in line with the Latin American average. It is never able to catch up with its selected peers (although it does get closer to Mexico). This is informative, but not a good base for comparison. We can try to normalize this figure and focus on the 2003-2016 timeline during which the Workers Party uninterruptedly held the Presidency in Brazil.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2\n\n\n\n\nWhen we observe the growth trends starting with the same normalized base in 2003, one can conclude that the statement that “Brazil took off” is probably not the best definition for what happened in the period. While Brazil does present a better trend than Mexico, it lags behind the Latin American average, Chile, and Argentina.\nThe two figures above also show that comparative measures accross different countries or even regional averages are not optimal. Our goal should not be to compare Brazil to any one other country, since it is clear that none of the lines above follow Brazil’s trend during our pre intervention period, so we cannot draw an informative conclusion on why Brazil has under performed or even if it has under performed at all. Maybe this trend was the best that the Brazilian economy could do in this period. In order to perform a more sound analysis, we must get as close as possible to constructing a precise counterfactual to the Brazilian economy. This is where the synthetic control method comes in, the topic of the final section of this research proposal."

    "section": "4- The Synthetic Control Method",
    "text": "4- The Synthetic Control Method\nFollowing Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller (2015), I close this research proposal by describing the mathematical model of the synthetic control method and explain how it provides a preliminary test for or against the validity of the hypothesis described above.\nThe intuition for the SCM is quite simple. When our units of analysis are a few aggregate entities (e.g. countries in a yearly panel), a combination of comparison units often does a better job of reproducing the characteristics of the unit of interest than any single comparison unit alone. Therefore, the result of our model is a synthetic control that is selected as the weighted average of all potential comparison units that best resembles the characteristics of the unit of interest in the preintervention period.\nI will further discuss the assumptions that must hold for us to get as close as possible to causal conclusions from synthetic controls in future assignments. For now, let’s dive into the setup of the model by defining our parameters.\n\nThe setup of the SCM\nWe have a sample of \\(J + 1\\) countries where \\(j = 1\\) is our country of interest (Brazil) and \\(j = 2,..., J + 1\\) are our potential comparison units (the 19 other countries in our sample).\nAll our units are observed at the same time periods \\(t = 1,..., T\\). There is a positive number of preintervention periods (\\(T_0\\)) and postintervention periods (\\(T_1\\)) such that \\(T = T_0 + T_1\\).\n\\(j = 1\\) is exposed to the intervention on periods \\(T_0 + 1,..., T\\) and the intervention has no effect on \\(j = 1\\) during periods \\(1,..., T_0\\).\nOur synthetic control will be composed of two key parameters: the weights assigned to the units of comparison (denoted as \\(w\\)) and the weights assigned to the covariates (also called the predictors of our variable of interest in SCM literature and denoted as \\(v\\)). The goal is to construct a synthetic control that resembles, as best as possible, the trend of the variable of interest (e.g. GDP per capita) of our unit of interest during the preintervention period.\nThe weights assigned to the comparison units are described by a \\((J \\times 1)\\) vector of weights \\(W\\), where:\n\\(W\\ =\\ (w_2,..., w_{J+1})'\\) (\\('\\) denotes the transpose of the vector)\nSuch that \\(0 \\le w_j \\le 1\\) for \\(j=2,..., J+1\\) and \\(w_2\\ +\\ ...\\ +\\ w_{J+1}\\ =\\ 1\\)\nThe weights assigned to our covariates are specifically denoted as \\(v_m\\), where we have \\(m\\ =\\ 1,..., k\\) covariates in the study and are also normalized to sum to 1.\nLet \\(X_1\\) be a \\((k \\times 1)\\) vector containing the values of preintervention variables of the unit of interest that we aim to match as closely as possible.\nAnd let \\(X_0\\) be a \\((k \\times J)\\) matrix collecting the values of the same preintervention variables for the comparison units.\nTherefore, the difference between preintervention characteristics of the unit of interest and the synthetic control is given by the vector \\(X_1\\ -\\ X_0W\\). We select the synthetic control \\(W^*\\) that minimizes the size of this difference.\nThe last parameter we must define addresses our variable of interest (think, again, of GDP per capita). We let \\(Y_{jt}\\) be the variable of interest of unit \\(j\\) at time \\(t\\).\nWe are now ready to derive our synthetic control.\n\n\nDeriving the synthetic control\nIn order to avoid the dangers of overfitting while still minimizing out-of-sample prediction errors, the first step in the derivation is to emply a cross-validation technique to choose the weights \\(v_m\\).\nWe divide the pretreatment period into a training period (I will use 1990-2001) and a validation period (I will use 2002-2006). Using the covariates measured in the training period, we select the weights \\(v_m\\) such that the result minimizes the root mean square prediction error of the validation period:\n\\[\n\\min(RMSPE)=\\min((\\frac{1}{T_0}\\sum^{T_0}_{t=1}(Y_{1t}-\\sum_{j=2}^{J+1}w^{*}_{j}Y_{jt})^{2})^{\\frac{1}{2}})\n\\]\nNow, we apply the the \\(v_m\\) weights derived above and choose \\(W^*\\) as the value that solves:\n\\[\n\\min(\\sum^{k}_{m=1}v_m(X_{1m}-X_{0m}W)^2)\n\\]\nThis results in a synthetic control that approximates as best as mathematically possible the preintervention trend of GDP per capita in Brazil. If the resulting synthetic control has a preintervention GDP per capita trend that is similar to Brazil’s, we will have succeed in our goal of building a reliable counterfactual to the Brazilian economy. Thus, since our counterfactual is a relibale synthetic version of the Brazilian economy during the preintervention period, but is not exposed to the intervention of interest during the postintervention period, we are able to estimate the effect of the intervention of interest on GDP per capita in Brazil as the difference in GDP per capita levels between Brazil and its synthetic counterpart in the years following the intervention.\nIn mathematical terms and following the definition of \\(Y_{jt}\\) above, the synthetic control estimator of the effect of the treatment in any post intervention period \\(t=T_0+1,...T\\) is given by the comparison between the variable of interest for the unit of interest and the variable of interest for the synthetic control at that period:\n\\[\nY_{1t}-\\sum^{J+1}_{j=2}w^{*}_{j}Y_{jt}\n\\]\nThe derivation above does not mention many of the technical details that corroborate for the validity of the SCM in constructing a reliable counterfactual to our country of interest. I am more than happy to dive deeper into these details in our subsequent submissions if you judge that to be necessary."
